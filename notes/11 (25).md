# Lesson 7 - 24/11

## Quantitative evaluation and analysis

For measuring interfaces:
- Effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction
- ISO 9241 Part 11

For comparing:
- e.g. different input methods, UI layouts...

For convincing:
- Getting "statistically significant" results -> evidence

### Evaluation of evaluation

- Internal validity: are we measuring what we think we are measuring? Was the evaluation done "right"?
- External validity: how generalizable the results are?
- Ecological validity: are the results applicable to real world?

### Error types

- Random errors
- Systematic errors:
  - Measurement instruments, e.g. accuracy for the pointing
  - Experimental procedures
  - Experimenter behaviour
  - Experimental environment

### Typical elements for an experimental study

- Controlled environment: tries to reduce confounding error sources
- Hypotheses
- Variables
- Procedure
- Analysis

### Conducting experiments

- Ethics considerations
- Participant recruitment: best if user that could really use the system
- Consent form
- Clear and same instructions for every participant
- Quiet space: if possible go near where the potential participants are anyway
- No interruptions: mobiles phones off
- Limit the duration of the experiments: have breaks and provide refreshments

## Study (the example)

### Validity & Reliablility

Validity:
- Internal validity
- External validity
- Ecological validity

### Hypotheses

- Null hypotheses
- H1: gestural interface reduces the task completion time
- H2: the mouse is the most accurate input method
- H3: cobination of gestural interface and mouse is the preferred input method

## Variables and study design

### Independent and dependent variable

### Two primary designs

### Variables in the study

Within-subjects variables:
- Independend variable: input method
- Dependent variables: time, accuracy, preference

Between-subjects variables:
- Independent variable: novice vs expert

### Scale types

- Nominal level
  - Activity categories
- Orginal scale
  - Ordering the input methods
- Interval scale
  - Time and error

### Controlling confounding variables

- Demographics and skill-levels: gender, age, background
- Training session: two different poses for each UI
- Balancing the order of stimulus: latin square (reduced form)
- Number of stimuli and breaks: repetitions

## Data collection

- Relevant knowledge about the participants
- Log file
- Taking notes
- Questionnaire
- End interview

### Challenges in questionnaire design

- Length -> loss of complete answers
- Engagement: questionnaires are often boring and repetitive
- Ambiguity
- Sampling: self-selection bias
- Data quality: erroneus and incomplete answers, data omissions

## Analysis

Start with an overview of the data:
- Visualize it
- How the responses are distributed?
- What are the differences between participants: exclude cases if necessary (outliers)

### Statistical analysis

- Statistical significance: rejecting/accepting null hypotheses based on p-value
- Selecting statistical test depends on:
  - Number and levels of independent variables
  - Scale type: categorical/nominal, ordinal/continuous interval
  - DistributionL can it be described with parameters?
  - Sample size

### Parametric and nonparametric tests

Parametric tests:
- The distribution can be described with parameters (e.g. normal distribution)
- Variable should be scaled by intervals

Otherwise, nonparametric test

Likert-scale:

### Sample size

The more participants, the better; the more samples the better.
If sample size is small -> use nonparametric tests

### ANOVA

Common method in within-subjects design is repeated measures ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance).
- Assumes that variables have equal variances
- Variables follow normal distribution
