# Lesson 2 - 05/11

## Perception

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-05-12-17-09.png)

### Visual perception

#### Visual acuity

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-05-12-18-00.png)

#### Visual attention

Aka where do we look at?
- Bottom up: optical flow, i.e. how the picture is formed and changed on retina, color, constrast
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-05-24.png)
- Top-down: influenced by task, e.g. searching something
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-05-32.png)

Eye movements:
- Fixations: length 150-600ms, approx 90% of viewing time
- Saccades: length 10-100ms
- Smooth pursuits
- Vergence shifts

Visual attention

Some **design implications**:
- Font sizes in user interfaces
- Foveated rendering, especially in virtual reality applications
- Visualisation of errors

#### Color perception

- Cone cells are receptive to different wavelengths
- Trichromatic colour vision
- People are able to distinguish ~10 million colors
- ! About 8% of males and 0.6% of females are red-green color blinds

Some **design implications**:
- Color systems
- Green and red not commonly used together
- Avoid visual clutter, also enable pop-out effects

#### Gesalt laws

Gestalt Principles are principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. Designers use the principles to organize content on websites and other interfaces so it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.

### Auditory perception

- Loudness, measured in decibels (dB)
- Frequency: for a young person, 20~20k Hz
- Binaural perception:
  - Difference between the intensity and the frequency at each ear
  - Important for sound localisation
  - Head-related transfer function (HRTF) for generating accurate spatial sound

Some **design implications**:
- Enables eyes-free interaction, e.g. cars
- Input: typicall speech-based
- Output: spoken responses, earcons (i.e. event related sounds, e.g. beeps), auditory icons, 3D spatial sound (useful in AR and VR)
- Binaural percetpion

### Haptic perception

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-05-12-51-51.png)

#### Tactile perception

Information from the skin, especially sensation of pressure (but also temperature and pain)

#### Kinaesthetic and proprioception

- Kinaesthetic: body awareness it is moving
- Propriocetion: perception of posture. Can be used in gestural interfaces (e.g. dab on lan)

#### In UI design

- Input: any button (e.g. keyboard), mouse
- Output: used typically as a simple feedback (force feedback, vibrations)
- Research driven for visually or hearing impairments
- VR

### Olfactory

- Based on sense of smell. Can be produced with umidifiers
- Not very researched but potential use is for increasing immersion in VR

## Ergonomics and cognition

### Accessibility

### Anthropometrics

Physical characteristics of the human body. Important in designing user interfaces, especially input technologies.

### Ergonomics

Physical:
- Relates to anthrompometry
- Important in designing user interfaces, especially input technologies

Cognitive:
- Concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning and motor response
- Mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress and training

### Fitt's law

Predict the time required to rapidly mode to a target area. Time is a function of the ration between the distance target (D) and the width of the target (W)

### Cognition

The mental processes involved in gaining knowledge comprehending and acting on it. Are involved memory, attention and decision making.

#### Memory

Different types:
- Central Executive: responsible for decision making and planning. Pulls and sends information to long term memory
- Short term (aka working) memory: capacity of holding a small amount of information in mind for a short period of time. Very limited, affects other thinking
- Long term memory: unlimited and permanent store

#### Recognition and recall

Humans may be good at recognition, say, a face, but worse at recalling, say, a name.

Some **design implications**:
- UI should have recognizable elements, such as symbols rather than need to remember exact commands

#### Attention

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-25-13.png)

#### Basics of information processing

- Visceral
- Behavioral/habitual
- Reflective/sense-making

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-26-09.png)

#### Some cognitive biases

- Anchoring: the first information is emphasized, and the following information are reflected against the first information
- Framing effect
- Confirmation bias
- Sunk cost fallacy: difficulty to let go something that one has put a lot of effort

#### Motivation

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-43-04.png)

#### Decision making in UIs

Gamification: using game elements and principles in non-game contexts (rewards, competition, etc...)

## Personality and emotions

### Personality

Trait theory says that there are five big personality traits:
- Opennes
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

Trais are shown to impact for e.g. social media usage.

### Emotions

- Mental sate associated with the nervous system
- There's no scientific consensus on a definition
- Affect:
  - Subjective experience of emotion
  - Arousal (e.g. skin conductance)
  - Valence (e.g. facial electromyography)
![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-06-11-46-27.png)

#### Emotions in design

- When happy/joyful:
  - More effective in finding alternative solutions
  - More tolerance to mistakes
- When stressed:
  - Need for a clear and unambiguous feedback

- Visceral design: Appearance
- Behavioral design: The pleasure and effectiveness of use
- Reflective design: Self-image, personal satisfaction, memories

## People as computer users

### Mental model

```
mostly imagined, dynamic models that we use in
everyday life to think about the world
```

Users will try to understand the underlying system. Necessary to break subgoals into actions.
There's a difference between novice and expert users.

#### The seven stages of action

### Design relevant user characteristics

- Antropometrics: physical characteristics of the human body
- Behavioral: perceptual and motivational characteristics, looking at what people canperceive and why they do what they do (e.g., affordance)
- Cognitive: learning, attention, and other aspects of cognition and how these processesinfluence design; users defined by how they think and what they know and what knowledge they can acquire
- Social factors: how groups of users behave, and how to support them through design; usersdefined by where they areâ€”their context broadly defined including theirrelationships to other people
