## Problem setup

ML: A computer program improves its performance on a given task with experience (i.e., examples, data).
So we need to separate
- Task: What is the problem that the program is solving?
- Performance measure: How is the performance of the program (when solving the given task) evaluated?
- Experience: What is the data (examples, features) that the program is using to improve its performance?
