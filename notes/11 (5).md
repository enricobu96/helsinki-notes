# Lesson 2 - 04/11

## Introduction: privacy

Many different definitions:

Difficult to define

## Some history on privacy failures

## Privacy legislation

### Europe: GDPR

```
(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an
identified or identifiable natural person.
[...]
To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all
the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or
by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.
```

- Applies to all personal data defined above
- Does not apply to anonymised data (where data subject cannot be identified or identifiable)
- Pseudonymised data is still under GDPR

### US: HIPAA (Health data)

Protects most "individually identifiable health information". Protected health information is information, including demographic information, which relates to:

- the individualâ€˜s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition,
- the provision of health care to the individual, or
- the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,

and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe can be used to identify the individual. Protected health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number) when they can be associated with the health information listed above.

## Privacy-enhancing technologies

### k-anonymity

Based on quasi-identifiers: set of attributes that can identify individuals; each value combination of quasi-identifier needs to be represented by at least k individuals

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-04-11-23-32.png)

- Susceptible to identification attack by combining multiple k-anonymised results
- Approved technology for satisfying HIPAA. Not clear if GDPR-compliant
- Extensions l -diversity and t -closeness address some weaknesses but do not resolve the fundamental problems
