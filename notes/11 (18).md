# Lesson 6 - 19/11

## Again on evaluation methods

When do we need qualitative research:
- Typical research question ”HOW...?”
- Focus on a “way of doing”
- The elements of an answer are not listed
- a priori
- When research questions are:
  - Open-ended (like How...?)
  - Non-quantifiable
- When a suitable (quantitative) theory is not available

### What are we aiming for?

Note: open-endedness does not mean no upfront planning needed

A succesful interpretation:
- Increases your understanding
- Is truthful to empirical evidence
- Is plausible

### Challenges of a successful interpretation

- In qualitative research, success is
  - harder to ascertain in advance
  - Less control on the phenomenon
  - Uncertainty on what the finding should be
- Requirement:
  - You have to remain open for novel insights until the very end of the study

### Saturation

### How to narrow down the scope

- Use triangulation ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-19-12-53-41.png)
- Avoid biases:
  - Confirmation bias:
     - Researcher organizes the study so that it prefers one alternative over another
     - Related: Leading questions and wording bias. (”Do you like this? Is this better?”)
  - Social desirability bias:
      - User guesses what the researchers would like to get as a result
  - Observer effect:
      - User feels awkward and behavior is not natural

### Two analysis methods

- Heavy weight: Grounded Theory, suits also for cases of iterative data collection and analysis
- Low cost: Affinity diagrams, a Post-It note based method

### General instructions

- Analyse by exploring different interpretations: here knowledge about previous research and theories is helpful
- Create early conceptualizations: “Go behind” your observations: what lies behind them?
- When you have a possible finding, try to verify it: be critical about your own interpretations; gather examples from your data from other participants and situations where the same finding should also appear
- Iterate between interpretation and verification

### More about interpretation

- Subjectiveness is not (necessarily) a problem
  - Different researchers can get different findings from the same data.
  - Intercoder reliability
- Know your data well
  - You often need to read through your data several times
- Transform all your data to readable/browsable form.
- Success in insightfulness depends on the depth and breadth of your knowledge
