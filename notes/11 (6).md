# Lesson 2 - 05/11

## Managing data and tools

Data wrangling challengs:
- DP: Data Parsing
- DD: Data Obtaining
- DI: Data Integration
- ER: Entity Resolution, aka recognising that two distinct pieces of information in the data concern the same entity. Includes duplication and record linkage
- FV: Format Variability, e.g. dates
- SV: Coping with Structural Variability in the data, e.g. wide/tall format, variation over time

## "Tools" for ML

- Introduction of software tools to implement AI methods: PhD no longer needed to run a complex algorithm, but may be needed to understand what happens
- Scientific publications often include OSS libraries to implement the methods
- Take-away:
  - Use the tools
  - Contribute to these tools
  - Recognize more the general computation problems and solve them instead of separately
- E.g.:
  - Keras for DL
  - Stan for probabilistic reasoning
  - R for statstical analysis
  - etc...

## Ingredients of ML

- Task is what an end user actually wants to do
- Computational problem is a (hopefully general) mathematical definition of the task. Usually includes some performance measure
- Model is a (hopefully good) solution to the computational problem
- Data consists of objects in the domain the user is interested in, with perhaps some additional information attached
- Machine Learning Algorithm produces a model based on data
- Features are how we represent the objects in the domain

### Task

- Is an actual data processing problem some end user needs to solve
- Typicall involves getting some input and then producing the appropriate output
- Machine Learning is a way to find a solution for this data processing problem when it's too complicated or poorly undestood for a programmer to figure out

### Computational problem

- Task can be expressed as an instance of a computational problem (more generic than task)
- Often some kind of an optimization problem

## Supervised learning

Many common tasks belong to the area of supervised learning where we need to produce soome target value
- Binary classification: divide inputs into two categories
- Multiclass classification: more than two categories

Multilable classification: multiple classes, of which more than one may match simultaneously.
Regression is when output is real-valued

### Supervised learning as a computational problem

## Unsupervised Learning

There is no specific target value of interest. Examples are:
- Clustering: partition the given dataset into clusters
- Dimensionality reduction: find an alternative lower-dimensional representation to high-dimensional data
- Association rules: given shopping cart contents of different customers, find product combinations often bought together

## Reinforcement learning

The learning algorithm can interact with its environment and learn from rewards it receives.
- Main idea: a learning agent is in some state s, and carries out action a, which takes the agent to state s'
- After taking some number of steps the agent receives a reward
- The agent aims to learn a policy that maps states to actions so that its total reward is maximised
