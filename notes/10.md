# Lesson 10 - 05/10

## GDPR for Data Scientists

### Why to know somwthing about?

Because of this:

### Reality is a million shades of grey

- You don't know clearly what's personal data and what's not; but law must split in these two categories!
- If it's personal data, the whole GDPR applies; if it's not, don't worry about it

### Rookie mistake: confuse law and reality

### When does GDPR apply?

- When there's personal data
- To any processing of EU citizens' personal data by automated means or manually if the manual processing forms or is intended to form a part of a filling system. !!! Place of data storage or location of the data owner is irrelevant

Definition of personal data is very broad:
  - Refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
  - All data that can be used to identify a person directly or indirectly (such as combining an individual data item with some other piece of data that enables identification, and personal data)
  - e.g. name, id, location data, ip address, fingreprint...

### However...

GDPR does not apply to anonymized data:
  - Anonymous data refers to data that does not relate to an identified or identified person
  - Question: can data be anonymized or there's the risk of de-anonymization?

Pseudonymous data:
  - New concept, a tool for mitigating risk
  - Data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (a key)
  - **Is still personal data**

### Lawful basis

Every data processing in UE is ILLEGAL! Unless...

Personal data processing must always have at least one of the following lawful bases:
- Consent
- Performance of contract
- Compliance with legal obligation
- Protecting vital interests
- Public interest
- Legitimate interest

If sensitive categories of personal data are processed, also an additional legal bases from Article 9 of the GDPR must be used

### Data subject's rights

- Right to obtain information on the processing of their personal data
- Right to access their data
- Right to rectification of their data
- Right to erasure their data and to be forgotten
- Right to restrict the processing of their data
- Right to data portability
- Right to object the processing of their data
- Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing

_Warning_: data subject's rights are not absolute and there are situations where some rights are not applicable!

### GDPR requirements for systems

Considering principles such as:
- Data minimization principle
- Accuracy principle
- Transparency principle

Considering data subject's rights:
- Right to have personal data deleted (Article 17) or
- Right to object the processing of personal data (Article 21)
- Right to data portabilty (Article 20)

Privacy by Design and Default (Article 25)
- Design: privacy must be taken into account already at the product development-stage
- Default: only necessary personal data should be collected -> _minimisation principle_
