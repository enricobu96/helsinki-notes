## HCI in health and wellbeing

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-12-01-10-22-08.png)

### Some domains for HCI in health

- Professional health systems
  - Usability of electronic health records
  - Usability of health care equipent
- Consumer health and wellbeing
  - Supporting for managing chronic illnesses: rehabilitation, self-tracking
  - Supporting healthier lifestyle and behaviour change: UX of fitness trackers
  - Support mental wellbeing

### eHealth and mHealts

- eHealth = electronic health
- mHealth = mobile health (applications on a mobile phone)

### Professional health systems

Usability of electronic health records:
  - Has been a huge issue (e.g. Apotti)
  - Many end-user groups with diverse needs (physicians, nurses...)
  - Diagnostic, health management, care planning, treatment documentation
  - Importance of matching the work-flow and the system

### Usability of health care equipment

Differences between assumed and actual use
  - Impact of context (distractions)
  - Can’t get easily at required information
  - Need workarounds
  - User adaptation not wanted
Lack of reporting on “user errors” in reports
  - Many instances where users had been harmed by “user error” based on design 

### Design of assistive technology

-> Supporting healthier lifestyle and behaviour change:
  - Obesity and sedentary behaviour as problems
  - Goal setting: personalization/tailoring
  - Self-tracking: activity bracelets have become common

-> Supporting mental health and wellbeing
  - Supporting data collection of depression and anxiety
  - Virtual reality for exposure therapy
  - Research projects

Challenge of preventive health:
- Unclear health problems as they are probable future occurrences
- Loose guidelines, remedies, therapies etc.
- Tracking results
