# Lesson 1 - 03/11

## What is HCI?

A field that researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (users) and computers?

### Why is it important?

We try to find the solution to an unfamiliar task. HSCI soves problems related to use of computing:
- observing existing use
- designing new technologies

### How is practiced

- Usability testing: e.g. comparing different versions of the same system
- Interaction design: how we design the interaction between machine and people
- Concept design: designing
- User/consumer research: find out how computer systems are used

### Linked fields

### What does good usability do?

- Utilitarian answers
  - Increases users' performance
  - Prevents human errors
- Financial answers
  - Return on investment
- Humanistic answers
  - Increases users' safety and well-being
  - Advances desiderable behaviour
  - Advances sustainability

To reach these targets, a human-centered approach is needed

### A step ahead

UCD (user-centered design) is cheaper than actual development
  - User research about users' needs to decide what to design
  - Heuristic evaluations before testing with users
  - Evaluating prototypes instead of full-fledged products

Anticipate critical decisions points later in the project
  - What is the most critically needed thing to learn next?
  - Consider UCD as "time travel": it answers questions about what the future might be like

### Waterfall

### Iterative

We'll use this during the project

### Lean product development

- Model for startups to become successful
- Experimentation over planning

## Important things of HCI

### User interface (UI)

The space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end

### Accessibility

Refers to the design of products, devices, services or enviroments so as to be usable by many people as possible
- In particular people with disability, but it's difficult to define what a disability is and what is not

### User experience (UX)

Person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service
- User's emotions are important

### Usability

A design is not usable/unusable per se, its features, together with the context of the user, determine its level of usability

Three important aspects:
- Effectiveness: accuracy and completeness with users achieve specified goals. e.g. measure = error rate
- Efficiency: resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals
- Satisfaction: freedom from discomfort and positive attitudes towards the use of the product

### Acceptability

A thing if accetable if it is sufficient to serve the purpose for which is provided, even if it is far less usable for this purpose than the ideal example. Requires longer usage in the real context.
Efforts on modelling it - technology acceptance model

### Interaction design

Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lifes. Leads to interaction designers.

### Service design

Activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality. So close to interaction design, uses similar methodology.
