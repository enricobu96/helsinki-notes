# Lesson 3 - 13/09

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data science role model
- Ability to observe
- Ability to convey what they see

### Exploratory Analysis - what is
- "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis earlier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data" - John Tukey, 1961
- Tukey found that too much emphasis was put on hypotesis testing (that is confirmatory analysis) and that a new kind of analysis was needed where hypoteses are suggested by the data -> R programming language comes from this idea

!!! Look at the data: big problems have been caused by not looking. Second best would be to look at the raw data: the further you get from the source, the higher the risk that you see artefacts of the pre-processing.

### Non-graphical EDA

Observations:
- Height is in metric units (cm) but weight in imperial (lb)
- Name can be 1-3 words (at least)

And then...

- Missing data
- What are these '_0'?

For table-formatted data (CSV) a spreadsheet can be useful...but mind the formatting!

There's error in the data!

### EDA classes
- Non-graphical VS graphical
- Univariate VS bivariate VS multivariate
- etc...

-> You should use them all! The basic goals are:
- Remove or correct erroneous data
- Formulate initial hypoteses
- Choose suitable anlysis methods

### EDA - why
- Any suspicious data need to be investigated and corrected or removed
- This can be quiet tricky: is it an **outlier** or a **finding**?
- After EDA, it may be easier to formulate hypoteses, and to make an informed choice of the analysis approach
- e.g.:
  - Choose between linear vs non-linear models
  - Choose distributions
  - Etc...

### Summary statistics
Simple summary statistics:
- Continuous: average, median, min, max
- Categorical: set of values, mode

### "CSI data science"
EDA can also involve looking for signs of data manipulation.

### Graphics
Basically: do graphics.

#### Choose the right kind of chart
Basic rule of thumb:

### Graphical EDA
- Distribution of a single quantity: histogram, boxplot

- Ne manca una

- Relationship between two variables: scatterplot
  ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-09-13-11-44-30.png)
  More variables can be included using color and size
