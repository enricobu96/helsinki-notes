# Lesson 8 - 25/11

## What's fairness?

We'll talk about:
- Justice: balancing conflitcting interests
- Ethics: principles of behavior
- Morality: distinction between right and wrong
- Philosophy: fundamental questions about existence, values, reason

## Brief history of fairness

### Types of parity

### (History of) fairness-aware ML

## Fairness-aware ML

Some concepts:
- **Unless instructed otherwise**, the learned model will carry the biases (of the data it's trained on) forward

### Machine learning and discrimination

Discrimination can have two different meanings:
- Distinguish (and that's ok)
- Inferior treatment based on ascribed group rather than individual merits (and that's bad)

- There are no right or wrong variables; determining which are the sensitive variables and what kind of justice should be aimed at is an extremely difficult and interdisciplinary problem

### Redlining

How can it happen?

-> removing sensitive variables makes things worse!

### Why unbiased processes can lead to discriminative decisions

- Data is "incorrect" (due to biased decisions in the past)
- Data is incomplete
- Sampling procedures skews the data
- The world is changing over time
