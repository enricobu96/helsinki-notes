# Lesson 9 - 16/02


RoT: Keep your model simple, but careful! May be a good idea starting with a complex one and then simplify it.

## Regularization - approach 2

### Ensamble learning

Which models to combine?:
- Different learning algorithm
- Same learning algorithm trained in different ways
- Also same learning algorithm trained the same way

We don't have a theory for dropout: it just works well

## Regularization - approach 3

Don't train too enthusiastically.

## Optimization

### Optimization approach 1

Choose non-linearity wisely:
