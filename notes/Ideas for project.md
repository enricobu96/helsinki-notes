# Ideas for project

Trivial, but covid data to predict the incidence, the rt index and the number of cases based on open covid data and/or other data -> give politicians and administrators a tool that allows them to "predict" what will happen (simple linear regression or similar)
  -> this can be extended e.g. with health/fitness data, like to do a research comparing health habits in different countries/areas in a country (e.g. people in a big city usually walk more than people in small cities)
