# Lesson 4 - 12/11

## Requirements without users - Heuristics

### What does it mean?

Heuristics = "rules of thumb". Any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, logical, or rational, but instead sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.
Design/usability heuristics:
- List universal guidelines and principles of good design
- Derived from research and practice
- Can be used with low cost during design and evaluation
- Do not require presence of users

### Where do heuristics come from

- Psychology:
  - Perception, affordances and gesalt laws
  - Memory and learning
  - Mental models and expertise
  - Motivation and emotion
- Task analysis and design
- Conventions and standards

### For experts

Shneiderman:
- Easy to learn
- Efficient
- Memorable
- Designed for error
- Satisfaction

Nielssen:
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

### Extending designing own esperience: empathy tools

Aka simulation tools to get first-person insight of users. Mostly applied to simulate reduced abilities (vision, dexterity, mobility)

## Conceptual design

- Transform user requirements/needs into a conceptual model:
  - What should the user's mental model be?
  - How should it support them to find and understand the system?
- Consider the gulf of evaluation and execution
- Help from metaphors

### Metaphors

- Resemble users' real-world experiences
- Important for helping in creating the mental models

e.g. desktop metaphor ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-12-17-34-35.png)

#### Metaphors vs affordance in UIs

### Design process

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-12-17-36-13.png)

#### Brainstorming

Osborn's principles:
- Go for quantiy
- Withhold criticism
- Welcome wild ideas
- Combine and improve ideas

Different methods:
- Nominal group technique
- Group passing technique
- Team idea mapping method

##### Design cards

Used to help brainstorming.

##### Scenarios

Can be used to understanding existing activities but are also used for expressing proposed or imagined situations. We have to explore the design space:
- What is possible?
- What are the options in the design?
- What are the dimensions?
- What are the constraints?

## Concrete design

### Rough sketching

Important to low-fidelity envisioning. People should not be inhibited about drawing ability, they could also use simple symbols.

### Storyboards

A series of sketches how user can interact with the device, typically created from scenarios. Good for communicating the use within a potential context (information about the details).

### Prototypes

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-12-17-41-39.png)

The purposes are:
- Exploration of a design space: interaction and technological possibilities, organizational and infrastructural constraints
- Tool for evaluation with users: in usability studies, MVP in the market
- Communication with others: concretization of a thinking process, presentation to a client
- Different kinds:
  - Horizontal prototypes: to investigate different many features or options
  - Vertical prototypes: to investigate certain feature in depth; task-based prototypes

Different characteristics:
- Not complete
- Should be easy to change
- Are an aid to achieve what you want

#### Different dimensions of prototype

- Representation, aka type of prototype
- Fidelity, aka level of details
- Interactivity, aka extent to which user can interact with the prototype
- Evolution, aka expected life-cycle (e.g. throwaway or iterative)

#### Prototyping methods

[less fidelity]
- Paper prototypes
- Wireframes, navigation maps
- Video prototypes
- Interactive prototypes
- 3D printed models
- Working code (aka partially working UI)
[more fidelity]

##### Paper prototypes

- Fast and cheap
- Low effort
- Easy to co-create

BUT difficult to communicate interactions

##### Wireframes

- Rough layout
- Models of the interface without styling and code

##### Navigation maps

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-12-17-50-14.png)

##### Video prototypes

Can be used for understanding how the input/output devices interact with each other BUT it may be difficult to determine how a new technology could be used in context of use

##### Interactive prototypes (Wizard-of-oz)

When development of real functionality is tedious -> faking the interaction

#### Prototyping tools

- Powerpoint/Keynote/OpenOffice
- Websites to get UI assets
- Interactive prototyping tools
- Partially working UI like Processing (program)

##### Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

Always use an arduino...

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-12-17-58-25.png)

...and/or a raspberry PI

#### Prototypes in the field

- To understand how prototypes can function in natural settings and become part of daily life
- Requires prototypes to be robust
- Used for extended periods of time to see if and how they become part of daily life
