# Lesson 4 - 14/09

## Advanced topics in visualization

Visualization techniques, and even the details, can be crucial in data analysis and communication of the findings.

### Tufte visualization principles (1983)

#### Principles of graphical integrity

- Representation (length, area, ...) should be directly proportional to the number, that is the Salvini diagram is wrong
- Clear labelling on the graphic itself, so avoit legends
- Show data variation, not design variation
- Apply inflation-adjustment for money
- The number of information-carrying dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data (e.g. don't use 3D graph if you have 2D data)

#### Principles of graphical excellence

- **Above all else, show the data!**
- Maximize the data-ink ratio
- Erase non-data ink
- Erase redundant data ink
- Revise and edit

### Data-ink ratio
The proportion of a graphic's ink devoted to the non-redundant data.

Apparently "cosmetic" things such as line weight and decorations (borders, labels, etc) can make all the difference; example:

Here the big bar on the title makes difficult to appreciate the differences between the graphs. How to improve:

Another example: even though you can produce a really cool visualization, it's not necessarily the best way to show the data or convey the idea.

(For example on the first you can just compress the data and do a 2D graph (5*5=25 on x and 0-50% on y))

Another example: don't use a higher number of dimensions if it's unnecessary!

## Geospatial data

Can be represented as:
- Vector format (points, lines, polygon)
- Raster format (bitmap laid over a square area)

In various formats:
- Shapefile
- GeoJSON
- Keyhole Markup Language, that is XML-based

With different tools:
- Python packages: shapefile, cartopy, geopanda, etc...
- Google Maps API
