# Lesson 3 - 10/11

## User understanding

- What kind of problem needs to be solved?
- Frameworks for framing the design
- PACT:
  - People
  - Activities
  - Context
  - Technologies
- ABCS:
  - Anthropometrics
  - Behaviour
  - Cognition
  - Social factors

### PACT

#### People

What kind of user?

#### Activities

What is the overall purpose?
- Temporal aspects: how regular/frequent? Time pressure? Continuous or interruptions?
- Cooperation: alone or with others?
- Complexity: well-defined or more vague?
- Safety-critical: how costly the mistakes are?
- Nature of content: amount of information? Dynamic or static?

#### Context

- Physical environment: outdoor/indoor, weather, space available
- Social context: other collocated persons, social norms?
- Organizational context: organisational culture, communication

#### Technologies

- Technologies available
- Input
- Output
- Communication
- Content

#### (Discussion)

- Background -> experience
- Physical aspect of the user (also diabilities, accessibility matters)
- Purpose of the user using the application

## Science

### General logic of a study and its stages

- Motivation: why the study is needed
- Background: what is already known
- Research questions
- Methods
  - Data collection
  - Data analysis
- Explication of findings
- Decisions and generalisation

### Gathering background knowledge

- Research articles (ACM, IEEE)
- HCI textbooks
- Internet sites ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-10-39-36.png)
- Similar products (**benchmarking**): watch on Apple Store and Play Store

### Formulating a research question

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-10-41-05.png)

### What is a good research question?

- Focused on a single problem or issue
- Researchable using primary and/or secondary sources
- Feasible to answer within the timeframe and practical contraints
- Specific enough to answer thoroughly
- Complex enough to develop the answer over the space of a paper or thesis
- Relevant to your field of study and/or society more broadly

### User centred methods to increase understanding

#### Operationalization: turning RQ into methods

The challenge: all RQs can be studied in several ways, which method(s) should I choose

#### Reliability and validity of a method

- Validity: method measures the intended RQ
- Reliability: method measures the RQ with good accuracy and detail

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-10-48-10.png)

!!! Both should be met in a good method

!!! We can use more methods, and then do **triangulation** and **redundancy**

#### Selecting participants

What types of participants best suit your objectives?

- Best way to do: **purposive sampling**
  - Selecting a specific group (e.g. certaing professional group, community, device users) and making sure to have enough in the group
- If this is not possible (some disciplines doesn't accept this): **convenience sampling**
  - Seeing who is available or is willing to participate
- Other: **snowballing**
  - Participants you meet refer you to other possible participants. Useful for the cases when initial access to the participants is not possible

### Interview

- Structured: the same questions for each participant, typically closed questions
- Semi-structured (best for HCI): basic script for guidance, but interviewer may ask further questions
- Unstructured

- Do not use complex sentences or leading questions
- Typical structure: intro -> warm-up -> main session -> closing with thanks
- Can be enriched with "probs" e.g. objects that participants bring with them
- Pros
  - Good for scoping the problem and answering "why" questions
  - Enables deeper understanding
- Cons
  - Laboroius to conduct and analyse |
  - Requires transcription and coding |

### Focus groups

- A sample of representative population of end-users gathered together (usually 3~5), lead by a facilitator
- Pros
  - Provides many views
- Cons
  - Some participants may dominate the discussion

### Questionnaires

- Typicaly used for gathering quantitative data
- Background information and opinions to statements (e.g. 1~5 grade scale)
- Pros:
  - Enables collecting a large amount of data quickly, especially if filled remotely
- Coins:
  - All the issues beyond the questionnaire are not covered
  - Typically do not help understanding on "why" questions

### Direct observation

- Typically observing a real world task, e.g. a professional conducting a task
- May be difficult due to environmental factors
- Level of own participation (your participation may affect the professional)
  - Shadowing: we observe them "20 meters behind" (affect the behaviour as little as possible)
- Pros:
  - Contextual factors includes
- Cons:
  - Difficult to analyse, lots of irrelevant data

### Ethnography

- The researcher observes participants from the point of vie of the subject of the study
- Typically used in studies that have a collaborative element, roots in social sciences
- Pros:
  - Allows designer to collect detailed and nuanced information
- Cons:
  - Typically not known **what** data

### Indirect observation

- Experience Sampling Method (ESM):
  - A short questionnaire sent to participant at random times
  - Typically to a mobile phone
- Diary: not only written, but also photos, videos, drawings...
- Log book

### Contextual inquiry

Observing the user in the user's normal activities and discussed those activities with the user.
- Pros:
  - The open-ended nature of the interaction makes it possible to reveal tacit knowledge
  - The information produced by contextual inquiry is highly detailed
- Cons:
  - A lot of information
  - All not generalizable across contexts

### Beyond user-centred methods?
- The methods so far assume that design decisions are taken by the designer.
- Expert mindset: Users are sources of knowledge but not active participants. Most of the knowledge is centralized (by the designer).
- An alternative perspective
  - Participatory mindset:  Users as active co-creators. 
  - Sharing values between user and designer

### Participatory design approaches

- Implies the active involvement of the people that are designed FOR and other stakeholders in the design work. (co-designers)
- Collaboration between people having various comptencies and interests
- Objects that are familiar to potential users can facilitate communication
- Users are given tools and techniques to relate their work/activity with technology
- Workshops
  - Participatory workshop
  - Co-creation workshop

### Action research

### Discussion

Interview: find some problems and ask them if they encountered it, ask them how to improve
  Different beckground: different experice, maybe different fields

## Presenting understanding

### Stories

- Typically real-world experiences or ideas
  - Snippets from interviews, videos, diary entries, photographs
- Easy to create and evoke conversation BUT vague, informal and incomplete

### Scenarios

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-11-42-29.png)

- Easy to create and evoke conversation BUT vague, informal and incomplete

### Use cases

- Describes the interaction between users (or other people) and devices
- Used to define what user does and what the system does
- Typically visualised using notation from UML

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-11-44-37.png)

### Task analysis

- Used to analyse what people are doing
  - Rationalisation and quantification of tasks
  - Tasks often follows certain patterns
- Can be differences between people
  - e.g. experts vs novices
  - -> tasks can be divided into subtasks

#### Hierarchical task analysis

- Tasks can be divided into tasks that may have substasks
- Useful for understanding the structure of existing practices
- Can be generated with observation and interviews

##### Notation

##### Generalizability and level of detail

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-11-48-28.png)

### State diagrams

- Can be used to express interaction's inputs and outputs

e.g.  ![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-11-49-12.png)

### User modelling

Modelling enables:
- Customization and adaptation of system to user's specific needs
- Optimisation

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2021-11-10-11-50-16.png)

Can be implemented by:
- Asking specific facts while (first) interactiong with the system
- Learning users' preferences by observing and interpreting their interactions with the system
- A hybrid approach which asks for explicit feedback and alters the user model by adaptive learning


- Basically the simpler the task, the more accurate the model
- Enables computational design

### GOMS framework

- Goals: the aims of the user when interacting with the computer
- Operators: possible interactions with the system
- Methods: sequences of sub-goals and operators
- Selection rules: the rules by which a user chooses a particular method

### KLM model (low level)

Aka Keystroke-Level Model. Specifies the sequence of operators and methods required to perform a task. Main function of a KLM analysis is to predict the execution time of interactive tasks.
