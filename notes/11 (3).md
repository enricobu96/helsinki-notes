# Lesson 1 - 02/11

## What is uncertainty

Bayesiam theory provides a consistent tool to represent uncertainty by probability and to update knowledge when new evidence is obtained

### Taxonomy of uncertainty

Two categories:
- Aleatory aka stochasitc uncertainty: originates from randomness, we cannot make observations that would help to reduce this uncertainty
- Epistemic aka knowledge uncertainty: originates from lack of knowledge, we can make observations to reduce it. Two observers may have different epistemic uncertainty

### Balls

- IF the ratio of the black and white balls is known -> there is aleatory uncertainty about the color of the next ball drawn
- IF the ratio is unknown -> there is aleatory and epistemic uncertainty present; the epistemic changes when balls are drown

  Description for aleatory answer:
  $y\in {0,1}$ (where 0=black, 1=white)
  $P(y=1|\theta)=\theta$
  $P(y=0|\theta)=1-\theta$

#### Quick recap on conditioned probability, marginal probability etc

Conditioned probability
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ and\ B)}{P(B)}$

Marginal probability
$P(B)=\sum_{i=1}^{\inf} P(A,B) = \int P(A,B)$

And then
$P(A|B)P(B)=P(A,B)=P(B|A)P(A)$

And finally, Bayes theorem:
$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$

### So, returning to balls and using Bayes

$P(\theta|y=1, I) = \frac{P(y=1|\theta, I)P(\theta|I)}{P(y=1|I)}=\frac{\theta x1}{C}$

### Again on taxonomy of uncertainty

Strict division between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty is problematic:
- in practice, part of aleatory uncertainty can be reduced to epistemic if we can add more conditions
- in philosophy...is there such thing as pure aleatory uncertainty?

### Probability as a measure of uncertainty

### Mathematical model

- A description of a system/phenomenon using mathematical language
- A good model represents well the essential aspecrs of the phenomenon of interest
- A formal tool for logical inference under uncertainty

### Updating knowledge
